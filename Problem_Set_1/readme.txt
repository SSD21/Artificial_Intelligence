Either load the file in pycharm or vscode or some other python editor and let the editor run the code,
or to run code through command line go to the file directory hosting the unziped code and use "python ProblemSet1.py"
to execute the code with the codes output going to console

how to read the output:

The program will output a the differnet problems as such

Problem A

Solution found!
 28 1 1 47 8 18
Problem A nva: 17870
Total nva: 17870

When it reaches a solution set it will print that it found the solution
Then it will print out found solution set starting with A and going through the alphabet till it finish the set
So for the case of Problem A it goes A B C D E F
It then just prints out how much nva that specific set cost and how much nva its taken up to that point in total nva
